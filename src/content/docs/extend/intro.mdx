description: How to extend and customize Tork
---

Tork's architecture makes it fairly easy to add functionality to the core engine.

This guide is intended for developers that want to extend Tork's behavior.

For configuring its existing behavior, refer to the [configuration](/introduction/configuration/) guide.

---

## Using Tork as a library

Create a new directory:

```bash
mkdir tork-plus
cd tork-plus
```

Init the Go project:

```bash
go mod init github.com/example/tork-plus
```

Get the Tork dependency:

```bash
go get github.com/runabol/tork
```

```bash
go: added github.com/runabol/tork v0.1.66
```

Create a `main.go` with the minimum bolierplate necessary to start Tork:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"os"

	"github.com/runabol/tork/cli"
	"github.com/runabol/tork/conf"
)

func main() {
	if err := conf.LoadConfig(); err != nil {
		fmt.Println(err)
		os.Exit(1)
	}

	if err := cli.New().Run(); err != nil {
		fmt.Println(err)
		os.Exit(1)
	}
}
```

Update your dependencies:

```bash
go mod tidy
```

Start Tork:

```bash
% go run main.go
```

If all goes well, your should see something like this:

```bash
 _______  _______  ______    ___   _
|       ||       ||    _ |  |   | | |
|_     _||   _   ||   | ||  |   |_| |
  |   |  |  | |  ||   |_||_ |      _|
  |   |  |  |_|  ||    __  ||     |_
  |   |  |       ||   |  | ||    _  |
  |___|  |_______||___|  |_||___| |_|

 0.1.66

NAME:
   tork - a distributed workflow engine

USAGE:
   tork [global options] command [command options] [arguments...]

COMMANDS:
   run        Run Tork
   migration  Run the db migration script
   health     Perform a health check
   help, h    Shows a list of commands or help for one command

GLOBAL OPTIONS:
   --help, -h  show help
```

## Custom endpoint

Let's use the `RegisterEndpoint` hook to register a new endpoint:

Update your `main.go` to look like this:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"net/http"
	"os"

	"github.com/runabol/tork/cli"
	"github.com/runabol/tork/conf"
	"github.com/runabol/tork/engine"
	"github.com/runabol/tork/middleware"
)

func main() {
	if err := conf.LoadConfig(); err != nil {
		fmt.Println(err)
		os.Exit(1)
	}

	handler := func(c middleware.Context) error {
		return c.String(http.StatusOK, "Hello")
	}

	engine.RegisterEndpoint(http.MethodGet, "/myendpoint", handler)

	if err := cli.New().Run(); err != nil {
		fmt.Println(err)
		os.Exit(1)
	}
}

```

Start Tork in `standalone` mode:

```bash
go run main.go run standalone
```

Let's try to call our new endpoint:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/myendpoint
```

If all goes well you should see:

```bash
Hello
```

## Middleware

Middleware functions allow you to intercept the operation of Tork at various points in order to handle commons tasks and/or enchance its functionality in some way.

Tork supports 4 types of middlewares:

- [HTTP middleware](#http-middleware)
- [Job middleware](#job-middleware)
- [Task middleware](#task-middleware)
- [Node middleware](#node-middleware)

Some common use cases for middleware:

- Authentication
- Authorization
- Logging
- Rate limiting
- Collecting metrics
- CORS
- Adding extra headers
- Modifying a job/task state

### HTTP middleware

HTTP middleware functions are functions that intercept the Coordinator API's HTTP request-response cycle. These functions are executed sequentially, and they have the ability to modify the request and response objects or end the request-response cycle prematurely. They act as intermediaries between the client and your route handlers, allowing you to perform actions before or after a request is handled by a specific route.

If the current middleware function does not end the request-response cycle, it must call next() to pass control to the next middleware function. Otherwise, the request will be left hanging.

Example of a simple middleware function to time requests:

```go
func main () {

	// code before

	mw := func(next web.HandlerFunc) web.HandlerFunc {
		return func(c web.Context) error {
			before := time.Now()
			// happens before the request is processed
			next(c)
			// happens after the request is processed
			log.Info().Msgf("The request to %s took %s to process",
				c.Request().URL.Path,
				time.Since(before),
			)
			return nil
		}
	}

	engine.RegisterWebMiddleware(mw)

	// code after

}
```

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/health
```

```json
{ "status": "UP", "version": "0.1.66" }
```

And in the logs you should see something like this:

```bash
12:13AM INF The request to /health took 88.125Âµs to process
```

### Job middleware

Job middleware functions intercept state changes to jobs within the same Coordinator that they are running on.

They act as intermediaries between the client and the Coordinator handlers, allowing you to perform actions before or after a job is handled by the Coordinator.

If the current middleware function does not end the handling of the job, it must call `next()` to pass control to the next middleware function. Otherwise, the job will never get handled.

Example of a middleware that logs job state change:

```go
func main () {

	// code before

	mw := func(next job.HandlerFunc) job.HandlerFunc {
		return func(ctx context.Context, j *tork.Job) error {
			log.Debug().
				Msgf("received job %s at state %s", j.ID, j.State)
			return next(ctx, j)
		}
	}

	engine.RegisterJobMiddleware(mw)

	// code after

}
```

### Task middleware

Task middleware functions intercept state changes to tasks within the same Coordinator that they are running on.

They act as intermediaries between the client and the Coordinator handlers, allowing you to perform actions before or after a task is handled by the Coordinator.

If the current middleware function does not end the handling of the task, it must call `next()` to pass control to the next middleware function. Otherwise, the task will never get handled.

Example of a middleware that logs task state change:

```go
func main () {

	// code before

	mw := func(next task.HandlerFunc) task.HandlerFunc {
		return func(ctx context.Context, t *tork.Task) error {
			log.Debug().
				Msgf("received task %s at state %s", t.ID, t.State)
			return next(ctx, t)
		}
	}

	engine.RegisterTaskMiddleware(mw)

	// code after

}
```

### Node middleware

Node middleware functions intercept heartbeat messages from the worker nodes to the Coordinator.

They act as intermediaries between the worker nodes and the Coordinator handlers, allowing you to perform actions before or after a heartbeat is handled by the Coordinator.

If the current middleware function does not end the handling of the heartbeat, it must call `next()` to pass control to the next middleware function. Otherwise, the hearbeat will never get handled.

Example of a middleware that logs heartbeats:

```go
func main () {

	// code before

	mw := func(next node.HandlerFunc) node.HandlerFunc {
		return func(ctx context.Context, n *tork.Node) error {
			log.Debug().
				Msgf("received heartbeat from %s", n.Hostname)
			return next(ctx, n)
		}
	}

	engine.RegisterNodeMiddleware(mw)

	// code after

}
```

### Built-in middleware

There are several middleware functions that can be [enabled and configured](/introduction/configuration/):

- CORS
- Basic Auth
- Rate Limit
- Redact
- Request Logger
- Webhook - responsible for executing job webhooks.
  Example of job webhooks section:

```yaml
webhooks:
  - url: http://example.com/my/webhook # POST (required)
    event: job.StateChange # event type
    # optional: headers to send when calling the webhook endpoint
    headers:
      my-header: somevalue
    # optional: conditional execution of the webhook
    if: "{{ job.State == 'COMPLETED' }}"
```

- Host Env - allows to inject a list of env vars from the host to any tasks running on that host. Supports aliases using `:`. Example config:

```yaml
[middleware.task.hostenv]
vars = ["SOME_ENV_VAR","OTHER_ENV_VAR:VAR_NAME_IN_CONTAINER"]
```
