## Requirements

1. Make sure you have a fairly recent version of Docker installed on your system. You can download Docker from the <a href="https://www.docker.com/get-started" target="_blank">official Docker website</a>.

2. Download the Tork binary for your system from the <a href="https://github.com/runabol/tork/releases/latest" target="_blank">releases</a> page.

## Installation

Create a directory:

```shell
mkdir ~/tork
cd ~/tork
```

Unpack the Tork binary:

```shell
tar xzvf ~/Downloads/tork_0.1.66_darwin_arm64.tgz
```

Run Tork:

```shell
% ./tork
```

If the installation is successful you should see something like this:

```shell
 _______  _______  ______    ___   _
|       ||       ||    _ |  |   | | |
|_     _||   _   ||   | ||  |   |_| |
  |   |  |  | |  ||   |_||_ |      _|
  |   |  |  |_|  ||    __  ||     |_

### Set up PostgreSQL

Start a PostgreSQL container

<Callout title="Note">
  For production you may want to consider using a managed PostgreSQL service for
  better reliability and maintenance.
</Callout>

```shell
docker run -d \
  --name tork-postgres \
  -p 5432:5432 \
  -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=tork \
  -e POSTGRES_USER=tork \
  -e PGDATA=/var/lib/postgresql/data/pgdata \
  -e POSTGRES_DB=tork postgres:15.3
```

Run a migration to create the database schema:

```shell
TORK_DATASTORE_TYPE=postgres ./tork migration
```

## Running Tork in Standalone mode

The easiest way to "kick the tires" is to run Tork in `standalone` mode.
This mode is ideal when running on a single machine.

```shell
./tork run standalone
```

```shell
 _______  _______  ______    ___   _
|       ||       ||    _ |  |   | | |
|_     _||   _   ||   | ||  |   |_| |
  |   |  |  | |  ||   |_||_ |      _|
  |   |  |  |_|  ||    __  ||     |_
  |   |  |       ||   |  | ||    _  |

```

### Run your first job

From another terminal, create a file named `hello.yaml` with the following content:

```yaml
# hello.yaml
---
name: hello job
tasks:
  - name: say hello
    image: ubuntu:mantic #docker image
    run: |
      echo -n hello world
  - name: say goodbye
    image: ubuntu:mantic
    run: |
      echo -n bye world
```

Submit the job to Tork for execution:

```shell
JOB_ID=$(curl -s -X POST --data-binary @hello.yaml \
  -H "Content-type: text/yaml" http://localhost:8000/jobs | jq -r .id)
```

Query for the status of the job:

```shell
curl -s http://localhost:8000/jobs/$JOB_ID
```

```json
{
  "id": "ed0dba93d262492b8cf26e6c1c4f1c98",
  "state": "COMPLETED",
  ...
}
```

## Running in a distributed mode

The broker is responsible for routing tasks between the Coordinator and Worker nodes.

You can specify which type of broker to use using the [config file](/introduction/configuration/).

`inmemory` (default) - Runs entirely in memory. Convenient for experimentation and development on a single machine.

`rabbitmq` - Uses [RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com/) as the underlying implementation. Suitable for a distributed setup with 2 or more machines.

Example of running RabbitMQ:

```toml
# config.toml
[broker]
type = "rabbitmq"

[broker.rabbitmq]
url = "amqp://guest:guest@localhost:5672/"
```

```shell
docker run \
  -d \
  --name=tork-rabbit \
  -p 5672:5672 \
  -p 15672:15672 \
  rabbitmq:4.1-management
```

Start the Coordinator:

```shell
./tork run coordinator
```

Start the worker(s):

```shell
./tork run worker
```

## Queues

By default all tasks are routed to the `default` queue.

All worker nodes automatically subscribe to the `default` queue in order to consume tasks, unless provided queue configuration.

Worker nodes can also subscribe multiple times to the same queue in order to execute N tasks in parallel. Example:

```toml
# config.toml
[worker.queues]
default = 5

[broker]
type = "rabbitmq"
```

```shell
./tork run worker
```

Will allow the worker to consume up to 5 tasks in parallel from the `default` queue.

It is often desirable to route tasks to different queues in order to create specialized pools of workers.

For example, one pool of workers, might be specially configured to handle video transcoding can listen to video-processing related tasks:

```toml
# config.toml
[worker.queues]
default = 5
video = 2

[broker]
type = "rabbitmq"
```

```shell
./tork run worker
```

Will allow the worker to consume up to 1 tasks in parallel from the `video` queue and up to 5 tasks from the `default` queue.

To route a task to the non-`default` queue, use the `queue` property:

```yaml
name: transcode a video
image: jrottenberg/ffmpeg:3.4-alpine
queue: video
run: |
  ffmpeg \
    -i https://example.com/some/video.mov \
    output.mp4
```
